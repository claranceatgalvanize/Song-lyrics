The grass is greener on the other side
That's what I thought before I took the ride 
I burned my bridges so I never look back 
But if I had know the life I was
if I had know the life I was searching for was already my own oo
Ire bènilê ooo, (ire ayo)
Ire ire ire
ire ire ayo
Onpemi oo (Onpemi kin ma bo o)
Oni kin ma bo (ire o)
Oni ki ma bo
ire
Ire ire ire (ire ooo)
ire ire ayo
Onpemi oo (ire, ayo)
Oni kin ma bo (oni kin ma bo)
Oni ki ma bo (oni kin ma bo)

The grass is greener when you water the ground
That's what I found when I took the ride
I realised the mountain I have been
climbing is nothing but standing oo
I didn't know I already had the answer
No I didn't know
For if I had know the life know (if I had know) the
life I was searching for was looking me right in the eye oo
If I had know the life I was searching for was already my own
Ire ire ire (ire o)
ire ire ayo
Onpemi oo (Onpemi o)
Oni kin ma bo (oni kin ma bo)
Oni ki ma bo (Oni kin ma bo)
ire
Ire ire ire (ire ooo)
ire ire ayo
Onpemi oo (its calling out to me dekunle it's calling out to me)
Oni kin ma bo (oni kin ma bo)
Oni ki ma bor (oni kin ma bo) (ire o)
ire
Ire ire oo ire ayo (distance chorus)
Onpemi kin ma bo (ire)
Edami shatokun fun Ese Mi
Jen pada sile
Majen sin won waye
Majen rin arin ra...
Alantere ooo
Ire she gudu meje
Oro shepete
Oro shepete
Ire Fi le poti o Fi ona roka
Kin ma bo (Ire)
